Communicate Data Findings 

Project 5 - Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

Data visualization
is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.

Exploratory data visualization
generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

Overview
FordGoBike System Data is used The FordGoBikeSystem dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. in 2017.

Explanatory data visualization
techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.
